          <i>This week is Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK. As part of this, I am sharing for the first time my experience of my cousin's suicide from 5 years ago. Opening up about mental health difficulties is challenging, whether because we're afraid of being judged, been seen as weak, or because it's stigmatised. And I too have struggled to write this, and have feared sharing it for quite some time. But we run the very real risk of losing lives if we are not able to open up about our mental health problems. So this short story, difficult as it has been to describe, is my contribution in bringing more awareness to mental health.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        Nothing quite brings awareness to the ill state of someone's mental health like suicide does. It displays completely the breakdown of someone's mind. I saw a quote once that said something like: "The worst thing about seeing someone fall is not being able to convince them that they have the power to save themselves by just standing up." But I never saw my cousin fall. Or, maybe I just didn't have the awareness to see him falling. I was emotionally blind to his suffering. So when he disappeared one morning, it never occurred to me he’d decided to disappear forever.
        </p>
        <p>
        My cousin, Liam, had made the choice to take his own life on 20th April 2016. He was only 22 at the time. Barely had he tasted adulthood. And me and him had always been really close. Best mates close. I'm from a large family with many siblings, and he was like another sibling amongst us. But nearly two months prior to his suicide he had experienced a tragic and traumatic event that led to the death of his mother and our grandmother. I felt responsible in helping him to recover, so I moved from where I was living at the time to stay with him. And for those two months following his mother and grandmother’s deaths he seemed, well, fine. Happy even. When we weren't busy in our jobs and studies, we would play video games, drink beers and watch movies together. We sang and laughed. A particular memory I treasure is one evening where we both, after having had a few beers, sang together the "You Got a Friend in Me" song from Toy Story. We grew up in the Toy Story era. Watched all the movies; played all the video games. The song at the time just seemed so right. It was me telling him "Look, Liam, we have grown up together. You're like a brother to me. I am here for you if you need anything. Remember that."
        </p>
        <p>
        One line from that song goes "You got troubles? Then I got em too". Except when I look back on it, I felt at the time as if not only did I carry his troubles, but that mine were heavier than his. What had happened to his mother, my Auntie, and our grandmother was difficult for me to cope with. Whilst he appeared to remain calm and rational, I was the one breaking down in tears. I felt weak.
        </p>
        <p>
        But weak as I was, my cousin must obviously have been suffering in silence. Eventually his suffering had come to breaking point. On a sunny Wednesday morning, rather than turn up at work (he worked in a car body repair garage at the time with his dad) he drove over to his mum’s home in Shirebrook, which sat just a short walk away from Shirebrook train station. And, after writing a short letter to his family, threw himself in front of an incoming train travelling at 30 mph.
        </p>
        <p>
        His dad had been calling everyone he could that morning to find out where Liam was. One of Liam’s close friends at the time rang me to see if I knew. I was at University writing up my final year dissertation when he phoned me. The last I’d seen of Liam was the evening before, where I found him nearly passed out in his car from cannabis intoxication. Stoned out of his mind, he could barely talk. I asked him to come back inside and get some rest. He did and went straight to bed. That was the last I saw of him.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then, late into Wednesday afternoon the following day, Liam’s friend rang me again and asked if he could meet me at my apartment (the one I was living in at the time with Liam). It was at that moment in which his friend broke to me the news about Liam’s suicide. The feelings I experienced were something like shock, despair, panic, confusion, pain, pain, pain. A pain that just felt so raw, I thought it would cause my heart to stop beating. A pain that prevented me from eating or sleeping for days afterwards. A pain that really incapacitated me. One that still visits me and incapacitates me every so often. I feel it now as I write this. Liam, my best mate, my cousin, had taken his own life. And I’ll never see him again.
        </p>
        <p>
        Call me rude for saying this, but when I look back at who my cousin was, I feel he was really wasted potential. Maybe I’m writing this with the anger I still have towards him for the decision he made. But he was incredibly intelligent, and had studied psychology at University. In fact we both began University at the same time. I was studying engineering and robotics, and we had some of the most enjoyable and engaging conversations I have ever had with someone. We would share with each other the things we were learning. But we’d also explore together other areas and fields too, and particularly physics, which was a passion of both of ours. At one point we became keenly interested in Einstein’s special relativity. (I still have some of the notes from where we performed calculations to compute the time difference between two observers travelling at different speeds.)
        </p>
        <p>
        I eventually went into the field of cognitive robotics (or neurorobotics, if you like), where the fields of neuroscience, psychology, robotics and engineering overlap. And it is with certainty that those conversations I had with my cousin, in which we would investigate the relationships between psychology and robotics, played a vital role in me going into this field. Yet despite Liam’s intelligence, he dropped out of University. He found it difficult to make friends, began drinking too much, and eventually gave up at the end of his first year. After that, he settled for a steady job, working for his dad in a car body repair shop. He also began smoking cannabis on a daily basis. And that was mostly his life for the next 3 years after dropping out of University: Work with his dad during the day, and smoke cannabis with friends during the evening. Our lives, sadly, began parting ways at that point. But I never expected we’d eventually part on such saddening and permanent terms.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have now begun a PhD in Computational Psychiatry. Jumping from one discipline to another, quitting one PhD to begin another, my whole trajectory in life is now geared towards understanding the brain and mind, and using that understanding to help those with mental health difficulties. I won’t stop in this quest. Whilst I wasn’t able to save my cousin, I’m determined to help save and improve the lives of others afflicted with mental health challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
        And I want us all to participate in this battle. One of the most effective, but perhaps most difficult, first steps in doing so is for us to admit and understand our own mental health difficulties. So, maybe just for this one week, during Mental Health Awareness Week, we can bring a little more mindfulness and acceptance of our own mental health and the mental health of our family and friends. I love you, dear reader. And I want you and your family to be well. Most of us will experience mental illness at some point in our lives. And there is no shame in that. The brain is a complicated and complex system, and that it goes wrong every now and again should be of no surprise to us.
        </p>

        I leave below the small note my cousin wrote to me before he died. Though short, it motivates me everyday to be a better scientist. Not just for him, but for the countless others who have gone through, are going through, and will go through the battles he faced.

            I thought it worth including here information for anyone who may be affected by this, or if yourself or someone you know
            is feeling suicidal. Information for those that require urgent help can be found at <a href="https://bit.ly/3uQZurT">Mental Health Today</a>,
            or you can call Samaritans on 116 123. If seriously urgent, call 999, or ask someone to call 999 on your behalf. For general information on mental health,
            you can visit <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/">https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/</a>.

            And don't be afraid to get in touch with me if there is anything less than urgent on your mind, or perhaps you'd also like to share your own experience. People's stories really give me
            the motivation to continue the work I do.
