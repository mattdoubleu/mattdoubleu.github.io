        <p>I was due to run the Manchester marathon this month, which took place on 10th October. For 3 months I had pounded the streets and trails of Edinburgh training for it. And whilst I sometimes missed a day or two due to my mental health difficulties, I’d reached the point where I could continuously run 21 miles. I was confident I could run this marathon. The first of many more, I hoped.
</p>
        <p>But when the day arrived, I couldn’t run it. My mental health had deteriorated 2 weeks prior to race day. I had damaged my body through alcohol and cigarettes to the extent where I could hardly walk for 26 minutes, never mind run for 26 miles. I felt a failure.
</p>
        <p>I haven’t fully shared the details of my family’s trauma, and do not intend to here. But for context, I feel it is necessary to at least explain it briefly. 5 years ago my family lost 3 close family members as a direct result of mental illnesses. My younger brother had developed a severe psychosis that led him to take the lives of my grandma and auntie. Shortly after this, my cousin, who was someone I’d grown up with and considered my best friend, took his own life. My brother has now been imprisoned for the last 5 years. And whilst his psychosis seems to have cleared, he just isn’t the same brother I once had. 2 weeks prior to the start of the Manchester marathon I’d found out he was put on suicide watch after passing out from blood loss due to self-harm.
</p>
        <p>My depression had been peaking for a while, and reached the stage where I was thinking, even ruminating, on a daily basis about suicide. I had dreams in which I was with my cousin and we were dying together. I felt happy during those dreams, though I always woke up in tears. These were happening over the course of around 2 months leading up to the marathon, with them occurring with greater frequency as time went on. And they became so exhausting that on some days I hardly had the energy to even leave my bed. I was entering a severe depression. With the increased depression, and then my brother’s self-harm, my mental health completely gave way. During the 2 weeks prior to the marathon I began drinking excessively, to the point of passing out, and picked up smoking, which is a habit I’d not really engaged in for 10 years. All I wanted was to escape the sadness and distress, and I used any means necessary to do that. Despite all the training I had managed to complete over the 3 months, 2 weeks of binge drinking, smoking, and poor diet had ruined my chance of running the marathon.
</p>
        <p> The hotel and travel plans had already been arranged, so I travelled to Manchester anyway to watch the runners. The atmosphere was warm, supportive, but also electric. There was live music and food stalls. Families had turned up to cheer on their relatives. Two young daughters and their mum were stood directly across the road from me with a sign that read “Go Daddy!”. Every runner received cheers, claps, and words of encouragement. I wasn’t necessarily feeling any regret at first, and I was somewhat happy to be on this side of the supporter’s divides rather than on the road. The atmosphere was so friendly, and I felt so much joy for the runners and their families, that I was put in a very good mood. 
</p>
        <p>A young woman, just adjacent to me on a street corner, was playing the guitar and singing beautifully. But she then began playing a cover of You’ve Got a Friend in Me by Randy Newman. And then everything hit me. This song was the last song me and my cousin played and sang together just a week before his suicide. I couldn’t take it. All the reasons I had for running this marathon began pouring into my thoughts. This marathon was intended to be in memory of the family I lost, but also as a means to improve my own mental health. But my poor mental health had ultimately ended my plans to run this marathon, just like the poor mental health of my family had ended their plans for life. I walked back to my hotel, holding in tears along the way. I regretted so deeply the poor decisions I had made that led me to this point of failure.
</p>
        <p>Upon returning to the hotel I told my family what had happened. But I also went one step further and, for the first time, told them about my recent mental health battles, and the thoughts of suicide. This was a watershed moment for me. They asked what they could do for me, and offered an abundance of support. My mum told me to forget about the marathon, and that the biggest challenge I’m facing right now is my depression and alcohol abuse, and to focus on tackling those first. That sure, I should keep running, given it’s an activity that provides me a lot of joy, but that I shouldn’t pressure myself with the challenge of running the whole marathon.
</p>
        <p>Instead of tackling the challenges of my depression and alcohol use, which are issues I had been battling with for a long time prior to this marathon, I had substituted dealing with those problems for the new problem of tackling the marathon. But it didn’t work. The seeds of the depression festered under the surface, and it invariably mushroomed up out of the surface when my resilience weakened.
</p>
        <p> But I now realise that the marathon hasn’t been a failure at all. Rather, it has been an important success. Because after hiding the worst of my depression from my family, friends, and everyone else, I finally took the courage to share it with them. And once I’d taken the first step in telling one person, initially my mum, I then gained the courage to tell the rest of my family, then my closest friend, my PhD supervisor, and now everyone that may read this blog post. 
</p>
        <p>It was so hard to admit that I was weak. And it was equally hard to cope with the distress that was caused by telling my closest loved ones about my depression, and particularly about the suicidal thoughts. I felt a great deal of guilt in doing so. But the distress they experienced upon discussing my suicidal thoughts were so much less severe than the distress that would have been caused by me actually committing to it. This is the most important fact I’ve learned after the events surrounding my cousin and brother, who both were in denial of their mental illnesses, or at least couldn’t admit to them.
</p>
        <p>But admitting you’re weak actually requires a great deal of strength. Particularly as a man, where you’re sometimes made to feel as if your manhood will be stripped from you if you admit that you have emotional vulnerabilities. Telling my family and friends about my mental illness has been one of the most challenging things I’ve ever had to do. But now, for the first time in what has been a good long while, I can say that I am rather proud of myself. I may not have completed the marathon, but I did win the support of my family and friends, and now feel I am on the right track to recovery. And that, I believe, is a great success.
