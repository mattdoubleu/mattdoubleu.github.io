                Computational approaches, such as Mathematical/Algorithmic Models (particularly Theoretical
                Neuroscience models) and Artificial Intelligence / Machine
                Learning, as well as methods from Physics, Statistics, Engineering and
                even Robotics, are now being applied to Psychiatry. But what is Computational
                Psychiatry really all about? And how will it help advance the field of psychiatry? This week I took
                part in the Computational Psychiatry Course given by the <a
                    href="https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/en/home" target="_blank">Translational Neuromodeling Unit </a> in
                Zurich, in the hope of finding out more!

              It feels like we’re entering an age of awareness with regards to mental health, with the term “mental
              health” becoming almost a buzzword in our current era. And thankfully, this is for a very good reason –
              understanding mental health is incredibly important if we are interested in bettering our lives! And in
              the midst of this mental health awakening has emerged a very new and exciting field named <i>Computational
              Psychiatry</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
              This week I was fortunate to attend the annual Computational Psychiatry Course, held in
              Zurich  (though this year online for obvious reasons), and organised by the Translational Neuromodeling
              Unit (a colab group between the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich). It was immensely interesting, and
              out of it I decided now would be a worthwhile time to try and figure out what, exactly, this new
              field of Computational Psychiatry is all about. So here is my (certainly naive, I'm still learning) take
              on this new field.
          </p>

          <b><i>What is Computational Psychiatry all about?</i></b>

          <p>
              I take it as a given that you are mostly aware of what psychiatry is all about – it’s the study of
              diagnosing, preventing, and treating mental disorders. But what about that <i>Computational</i> term? What
              does  that mean, exactly? Well, something that is computational is something that does computations
              (duh?). Computations are something that computers do (again, duh?). But you may be surprised to know
              that  humans are also computing machines, doing computations, via our brains and nervous systems, all
              the  time! A computation can be seen as a mapping from some input to some output; be that keyboard
              inputs  to display outputs in a computer, or sensory inputs to behavioural outputs in a human, the
              thing  in the middle that converts those inputs to the outputs are the computations. And that thing in
              the middle is usually a sequence of steps, an algorithm if you will, or perhaps a mathematical
              operation, that transforms the inputs to the outputs.
          </p>
          <p>
              And so Computational Psychiatry is a field that attempts to apply this computational approach to the
              problems found in psychiatry, hopefully in order to provide answers and insights into those problems.
              So just to take one such example of this in practice, what if we want to predict how effective a
              certain treatment is on the outcome of a patient? Say we want to determine how effective an
              anti-depressant drug will be in treating someone suffering from depression. A computational approach
              may take the anti-depressant drug as an input, model the patient as a computational process, and
              predict the effectiveness of the drug for alleviating the symptoms of depression in the patient.  So,
              framing it as a computational process, we’d say something like the following: the treatment is the
              input, the patient is the computational unit, and the treatment effectiveness is the output.
          </p>
          <p>
              Why might this work? Well, remember again that we humans are also computers doing our computations.
              And so if humans are computing machines, then it should be the case that we can, theoretically at
              least, determine what those computations are in such a way that we can perform the mapping from input
              to output as described above. To do this, we would build a computational model that captures the
              computations performed by humans. (A computational model of the brain!) This could be something like  a
              model that describes how neurotransmitters and neuromodulators will behave in certain areas of the
              brain as a consequence of drug administration.
          </p>
          <p>
              But computational psychiatry goes beyond this already exciting idea. Beyond treatment  prediction,
              Computational Psychiatry tries to provide answers and insights to another two closely related and
              critical problems within psychiatry:
          </p>
          <ol>
              <li>Dissecting spectrum disorders – Though patients can often be diagnosed with the same disorder,
                  they can each exhibit very different symptoms. Dissecting spectrum disorders involves properly
                  categorising an illness into its appropriate subgroup within the spectrum disorder.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Differential diagnosis – Making the correct diagnosis amongst many diagnoses that share the      same
                  symptoms or clinical features.
              </li>
          </ol>

          <b><i>Taking a case example – Schizophrenia</i></b>

          <p>
              To better understand each of these problems, and how computational psychiatry would be used to help
              advance them, I’ll take the example of Schizophrenia to demonstrate.
          </p>
          <p>
              Schizophrenia (Sz) is a spectrum disorder, which means the underlying condition of Sz can cause a range
              of different symptoms. According to the <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders" target="_blank">
              Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> DSM), diagnosing Sz requires a patient to
              exhibit at least one of the following symptoms for over a month (these are the main, positive symptoms):
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Delusions</li>
              <li>Hallucinations</li>
              <li>Disorganised speech</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              And then at least one of these symptoms too:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviour (lack of movement and communication)</li>
              <li>Negative symptoms – these include things like: <i>flat effect</i> (showing no emotional expressions);
                  <i>anhedonia</i> (inability to feel pleasure); <i>avolition</i> (lack of motivation to do basic
                  activities, like housework, cooking etc.); <i>asociality</i> (being socially disinterested, or having
                  no motivation to socialise with anyone)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              But notice that it is possible with this definition to have two patients, both with very different
              symptoms, yet both receiving the same diagnosis of Sz. For instance, patient 1 could have symptoms of
              delusions, hallucinations and asociality, whilst patient 2 has disorganized speech and catatonic
              behaviour. Both diagnosed under the umbrella term Sz, yet both showing very different symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
              In addition, Autism, another spectrum disorder, shares similar symptoms with Sz. For instance,
              <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/autism-diagnosis-criteria-dsm-5" target="_blank">symptoms of Autism</a> can also
              include communication that exhibits few words of intelligible speech (disorganised speech, above), and
              showing lack of social engagement, or a lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication
              (negative symptoms, above).
          </p>
          <p>
              We see then that it may be possible to have two patients with Sz exhibit very different symptoms (the
              problem of dissecting spectrum disorders), whilst two patients with different diagnoses (Sz and
              Autism) share the same symptoms (the problem of differential diagnosis). And it is easy to see how
              this could result in errors in diagnosing. Rather than using symptoms as a means to diagnosis, what we
              need is a more refined, mechanistic approach. We need something <i>Computational!</i>
          </p>
          <p>
              One computational approach to this problem is to use machine learning on data, in order to recognise
              clusters within the data, or to classify based on that data. And one of the best sources of data we
              have currently for how brain activity correlates with behaviour is <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging" target="_blank">fMRI</a>
               data. In this instance, the fMRI data is our input, the machine learning approach is our computation,
              and the output is the diagnosis prediction. So we see it is still a computational approach. In our
              example here with Sz, what this could mean is that we use machine learning approaches on fMRI data.
              Based on this fMRI data, a machine learning system could correlate certain features in the fMRI data
              associated with the illness of Sz, so that a proper diagnosis of Sz can be made – either to separate
              it from other diagnoses (differential diagnosis) or to properly classify it in the appropriate
              subgroup within a spectrum disorder (dissecting spectrum disorders). This quantitative, mechanistic,
              computational approach is very different to the symptomatic approach used in the DSM above. And very
              likely many times more accurate once properly realised!
          </p>

          <b><i>Computational Psychiatry could be our best route to a properly scientific, quantitative approach to
              psychiatry</i></b>

          <p>
              Klaas Enno Stephan described in his closing talk on the opening day of the Computational Psychiatry
              Course that the greatest problem facing psychiatry right now is in having the ability to predict. That
              is, to predict the causes of a mental illnesses, as well as predict the response of treatments. And
              computational approaches are, despite them being the most difficult to develop (technically and
              scientifically), very likely to be our best route to doing just that!
